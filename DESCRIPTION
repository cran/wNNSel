        Selected Variables

Description: New tools for the imputation of missing values in high-dimensional
    data are introduced using the non-parametric nearest neighbor methods. It
    includes weighted nearest neighbor imputation methods that use specific
    distances for selected variables. It includes an automatic procedure of cross
    validation and does not require prespecified values of the tuning parameters.
    It can be used to impute missing values in high-dimensional data when the sample
    size is smaller than the number of predictors. For more information see Faisal
    and Tutz (2017) <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2015-0098>.
